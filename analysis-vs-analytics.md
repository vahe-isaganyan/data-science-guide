# Analysis
In analysis, you take a large data set and break it up and study each piece of data individually. Analysis is done on things that have already happened. For example, using analysis to look into sales numbers over the past year and noticing a decrease during the winter.

# Analytics
In analytics, you look into potential future events. It is logical and computational reasoning. You are looking for patterns and exploring what you may do with them in the future. Analytics can be branched off into two areas:

## Qualitative
This is using intuition + analysis to plan your next use. For example, imagine a company that wants to improve its customer service. They decide to conduct a series of focus groups with their customers to gather feedback. In these focus groups, customers are asked open-ended questions about their experiences with the company’s customer service.

The responses from these focus groups are then analyzed using qualitative analytics. This might involve coding the responses into different categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and identifying common themes or patterns. For example, if many customers mention long wait times or unhelpful representatives, these issues would be identified as areas for improvement.

This type of analysis is qualitative because it’s based on non-numerical data. Instead of looking at numbers or statistics, qualitative analytics focuses on understanding the underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations behind the data. It provides insights that can help the company make informed decisions about how to improve their customer service.

Remember, the goal of qualitative analytics is not to count how many times something occurs, but to understand the why and how of a situation. It’s about exploring the depth, meaning, and interpretation of the data.

## Quantitative
Applying formulas and algorithms to numbers you have gathered from your analysis. For example, let’s say a retail company wants to understand the shopping behavior of its customers. They collect data such as the number of purchases each customer makes, the total amount each customer spends, the time of day they shop, and the types of products they buy.

This data is then analyzed using quantitative analytics. The company might calculate the average number of purchases per customer, the average amount spent per customer, and the most popular shopping times. They might also use statistical methods to identify correlations, such as whether customers who buy product A are also likely to buy product B.

This type of analysis is quantitative because it’s based on numerical data and often involves statistical methods. The goal is to quantify behaviors, opinions, or other variables and make predictions about future behavior based on this data.

In this case, the insights gained from the quantitative analytics could help the company make decisions about when to schedule sales, which products to promote together, or how to target their marketing efforts.

Remember, the goal of quantitative analytics is to answer questions like how many, how much, and how often. It’s about measuring and quantifying data to make informed decisions.
